With the popularity of IoT technologies, security has become a significant concern.
IDS is a crucial component that analyzes IoT network activity and categorizes it as either normal or abnormal due to susceptible attacks from hackers.
An IDS safeguards a system's availability, integrity, and confidentiality. Because of resource constraints and algorithmic complexity, 
traditional ML IDS have drawbacks when applied to IoT networks. A lightweight IoT IDS that is optimal, inexpensive, and can minimize the loss function 
is necessary to create. So, to find the optimal model parameter values of the ML algorithm, hyperparameter tuning is performed by using population-based
swarm algorithms. The swarm-based algorithms control the learning process to extract the ML algorithms' relevant parameters and ultimately learn.
A comparative study between the proposed hyperparameter tuning and default parameters predictions is made. The experimental results confirmed that 
the proposed approach effectively enhances the security of the IoT environment. This approach is evaluated and determined 
to be promising on the MSCA benchmark IDS data set. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves a good trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency with higher accuracy than default Tree based ML parameters.
